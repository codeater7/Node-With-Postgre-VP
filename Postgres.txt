When we create a new instance of the Pool module, we define connection settings in the configuration object. 
The default Postgres SQL port is 5432, and we are running it in the localhost. 
You can check these settings by typing \conninfo command in the SQL Shell. 
If your port is different, you have to change it to the db/index.js file.
